The Magar Akkha script is a version of the Brahmi script, that has been used since about the 11th century AD. It is still used to some extent to write Magar, a Tibeto-Burman language spoken in parts of Nepal, and northeast of India. It is taught in some schools and used in one newspaper. These days, the Devanagari script is more commonly used to write Magar.
